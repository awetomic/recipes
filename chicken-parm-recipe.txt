Ingredients:
 - 3 tablespoons olive oil
 - 1 teaspoon chopped fresh rosemary leaves
 - 1 teaspoon chopped fresh thyme leaves
 - 1 teaspoon chopped fresh Italian parsley leaves
 - Salt and freshly ground black pepper
 - Eight 3-ounce chicken cutlets
 - 1 1/2 cups Simple Tomato Sauce, recipe follows, or purchased marinara sauce
 - 1/2 cup shredded mozzarella
 - 16 teaspoons grated Parmesan
 - 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into pieces
 - Simple Tomato Sauce:
 - 1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil
 - 1 small onion, chopped
 - 2 cloves garlic, chopped
 - 1 stalk celery, chopped
 - 1 carrot, chopped
 - Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper
 - Two 32-ounce cans crushed tomatoes
 - 4 to 6 fresh basil leaves
 - 2 dried bay leaves
 - 4 tablespoons unsalted butter, optional

Directions:
1. Preheat the oven to 500 degrees F.

2. Stir the oil and herbs in a small bowl to blend. 
   Season with salt and pepper. 
   Brush both sides of the cutlets with the herb oil. 
   Heat a large heavy oven-proof skillet over high heat. 
   Add the cutlets and cook just until brown, about 2 minutes per side. 
   Remove the skillet from the heat.

3. Spoon the marinara sauce over and around the cutlets. 
   Sprinkle 1 teaspoon of the mozzarella over each cutlet, then sprinkle 2 teaspoons of the Parmesan over each. 
   Sprinkle the butter pieces atop the cutlets. 
   Bake until the cheese melts and the chicken is cooked through, about 3 to 5 minutes.

Simple Tomato Sauce:
1. In a large casserole pot, heat the oil over medium high heat. 
   Add the onion and garlic and saute until soft and translucent, about 2 minutes. 
   Add the celery and carrots and season with salt and pepper. 
   Saute until all the vegetables are soft, about 5 minutes. 
   Add the tomatoes, basil, and bay leaves and simmer covered on low heat for 1 hour or until thick. 
   Remove the bay leaves and check for seasoning. 
   If the sauce still tastes acidic, add unsalted butter, 1 tablespoon at a time to round out the flavors.

2. Add half the tomato sauce into the bowl of a food processor. 
   Process until smooth. 
   Continue with the remaining tomato sauce.

3. If not using all the sauce, allow it to cool completely and pour 1 to 2 cup portions into freezer plastic bags. 
   This will freeze up to 6 months.
